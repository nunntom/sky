// db_pool.go — connection-pool sizing and transaction isolation for
// Std.Db.
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// Until v0.20.3 `Db_connect` clamped SQLite to a single connection and
// let every other driver fall through with a comment asserting that
// "their connection pool defaults are already sane". That assertion was
// false. Go's `database/sql` zero values are:
//
//	MaxOpenConns    = 0   → UNLIMITED
//	MaxIdleConns    = 2
//	ConnMaxLifetime = 0   → connections never expire
//	ConnMaxIdleTime = 0   → idle connections are never reaped
//
// Against PostgreSQL that is two failure modes, not one:
//
//  1. Above the knee, `MaxOpenConns = 0` opens one backend per
//     concurrent query. PostgreSQL's own `max_connections` default is
//     100 and each backend is a PROCESS costing ~5–10 MB, so a burst
//     stops being slow and starts being `FATAL: sorry, too many clients
//     already` — a hard outage for every connection after the hundredth,
//     including the operator's psql.
//  2. Below the knee, `MaxIdleConns = 2` means a pool that briefly grew
//     to 20 closes 18 of them the moment the burst ends and re-dials
//     them on the next one. A PostgreSQL connect is a fork + auth +
//     (usually) a TLS handshake; paying it per request is the churn that
//     makes a healthy database look slow.
//
// Neither is theoretical and neither is visible in a test that runs one
// query at a time, which is why the false comment survived: nothing
// contradicted it until the load did.
//
// # Deployment-aware sizing
//
// The correct pool size is not a property of the app, it is a property
// of how many copies of the app there are. On a VM the app is one
// process and can afford a pool proportional to its CPUs. On request-
// billed serverless the platform runs many small instances and EACH
// holds a pool — the same per-instance number that is conservative on a
// VM is a connection storm across fifty Cloud Run instances.
//
// The runtime already knows which world it is in: `IsServerless()` in
// serverless.go reads the platform fingerprints (`K_SERVICE`,
// `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`, …) and `exporter.go` already varies its
// flush cadence on it. This file reuses that single detector rather than
// growing a second one.
//
// # SQLite is deliberately not tunable here
//
// The `MaxOpenConns(1)` clamp on SQLite is a CORRECTNESS constraint, not
// a tuning choice: SQLite has one global writer lock, and letting
// `database/sql` open a second connection reintroduces the SQLITE_BUSY
// class that `db_connect_defaults_test.go` exists to keep closed. The
// pool env vars are therefore ignored on SQLite, with a warning, rather
// than silently honoured into a regression.

// pools provided, so each consumer carries a cap.
//
// The caps are asymmetric on purpose. The session store is on the REQUEST
// path — every request reads and writes its session — so capping it below the
// pool would be capping the app itself for no benefit. The two BACKGROUND
// writers are capped instead, and capping them is what guarantees the session
// store cannot be starved: analytics and telemetry together can hold at most
// `dbAnalyticsShare + telemetry.Share` of the pool, so the session store
// always has the rest.

// Both background writers are single-goroutine batchers after the buffered
// writer landed, so a cap of 2 costs them nothing: one slot for the flusher,
// one for a concurrent read (the console tab, an erase, a prune).
// dbAnalyticsShare is the analytics writer's cap. dbSessionShare is 0, meaning
// uncapped — the hot path draws on the whole pool, and the background caps are
// what keep it from being consumed.

// would be exactly the message-text classification `dbIsRetryableTxError`
// refuses to do, so the flag is set at the point the typed error is
// still in hand.

// Only installed when a retry budget is configured; otherwise
// `executor()` hands back the bare `*sql.Tx` and this file costs

// KNOWN GAP: `QueryRow` defers its error to `Scan`, so a conflict raised
// by the one `QueryRow` call site (the `INSERT … RETURNING id` path in
// `dbInsertRowBody`) is not seen here. It is still caught at COMMIT,
// which is where PostgreSQL reports a conflict the statement did not.
