Sky is a **fullstack functional language that compiles to typed Go**.
You write Elm-style syntax — explicit types, exhaustive pattern matching,
no runtime exceptions — and ship a single static binary with a
batteries-included stdlib, observability built in, and any Go package
just an `import` away. One `init / update / view` runs it **server-side**
(Sky.Live) or **client-side in wasm** (Sky.Spa) — same source, different reach.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Std.Log exposing (println)

main =
    println "Hello from Sky!"
```

```bash
sky init hello && cd hello && sky run src/Main.sky
```

## Why Sky

- **If it compiles, it works.** Every side effect returns
  `Task Error a`; every fallible value returns `Result Error a`;
  `sky check` invokes `go build` on the emitted Go so any shape
  mismatch surfaces at type-check time. There is no runtime null,
  no uncaught exception, no silent numeric coercion.
- **One language, every shape — including cross-platform.** The same
  `init / update / view / subscriptions` source compiles to a
  server-rendered web app (Sky.Live), a terminal UI (Sky.Tui), a native
  desktop window (Sky.Webview), or a **wasm client** (Sky.Spa) shipped to
  **web, desktop, iOS, and Android** from one codebase. One `Std.Ui`
  `Element` view paints to the DOM, to ANSI cells, or to a native webview.
- **Batteries included.** Auth, database, HTTP client + server,
  WebSocket, JSON, JWT, CSV, email, encryption, observability —
  every primitive a real app needs is in the stdlib (`Std.Db`,
  `Std.Auth`, `Std.Ui`, `Std.Cache`, `Std.Email`, …) and
  documented with `sky doc --serve`.
- **Go's whole ecosystem.** `sky add github.com/some/package` —
  the compiler introspects the Go package and generates strict,
  typed Sky bindings. No hand-written FFI glue. Stripe SDK
  (~76k FFI symbols) compiles and tree-shakes to a 4k-line
  `main.go`.
- **AI-friendly by design.** Explicit annotations, exhaustive
  pattern matching, no implicit coercions, no exceptions. LLMs
  generate code that compiles the first time. The shipped
  `CLAUDE.md` and `sky init`'s starter `CLAUDE.md` give any
  AI assistant the load-bearing context to scaffold production
  apps directly.
- **One binary out the back.** Every project compiles to a
  static Go binary. Deploy with `scp`, with Docker, or as a CLI
  you `brew install`.

## Why the compiler is in Rust

The Haskell compiler carried Sky through v0.17. The push to v1 — "if it
compiles, it works" end to end, on an architecture that stays
maintainable — surfaced limits in it that were structural rather than
incidental: a monolithic multi-thousand-line lowering pass, mutable
`IORef` compiler state that fought the very purity Sky promises its
users, and an HM solver that needed hard memory budgets to stay bounded.
The rewrite moves the compiler to a Rust cargo
workspace of small, single-responsibility crates — lexer/parser, name
resolution, HM inference, type-directed lowering, Go codegen, FFI,
formatter, LSP — so each architectural decision sits behind a real
module boundary instead of inside one file, and a query-DAG core makes
incremental rebuilds and cross-module analysis robust by construction.
Rust earns its place specifically: it compiles the corpus faster and
with a lower, more predictable memory profile, and its algebraic enums,
enforced exhaustiveness, and absence of null mirror the discipline Sky
itself enforces — the compiler is now written in the same style it
compiles. The typed-Go output and the "if it compiles, it works"
contract carry over unchanged; every one of v0.17's hard-won learnings
is now a crate boundary, a gate, or a test, which is what makes the v1
goals reachable. The retired Haskell compiler stays under
[`legacy-haskell-compiler/`](legacy-haskell-compiler/) as a
byte-for-byte differential oracle until v1 is tagged.

## Hello, Sky

A counter web app — type-checked, server-driven, no JavaScript.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Core.Error exposing (Error)
import Sky.Core.Task exposing (Task)
import Std.App as App
import Std.Cmd as Cmd
import Std.Sub as Sub
import Std.Ui as Ui exposing (Element)
import Std.Ui.Font as Font


type Msg
    = Increment
    | Decrement


type alias Model = { count : Int }


init : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init _ = ( { count = 0 }, Cmd.none )


update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment -> ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none )
        Decrement -> ( { model | count = model.count - 1 }, Cmd.none )


view : Model -> Element Msg
view model =
    Ui.row [ Ui.spacing 16, Ui.padding 24 ]
        [ Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Decrement, label = Ui.text "−" }
        , Ui.el [ Font.size 24 ] (Ui.text (String.fromInt model.count))
        , Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Increment, label = Ui.text "+" }
        ]


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions _ =
    Sub.none


appDef =
    App.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view, subscriptions = subscriptions }
        |> App.withNotFound ()


main : Task Error ()
main =
    App.run appDef
```

```bash
sky run src/Main.sky    # http://localhost:8000
```

One `App.app` source, one `--target` per shape: bare (or `--target web`) serves
it over Sky.Live; `--target terminal:tui` paints the same `view` to a terminal
canvas; `--target desktop` wraps it in a native desktop window.

## Install

```bash
# macOS / Linux — single-binary install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anzellai/sky/main/install.sh | sh

# or build from source (Rust toolchain required to build the compiler)
git clone https://github.com/anzellai/sky
cd sky/rust && cargo build --release -p sky
# or install straight to ~/.local/bin:
#   cargo install --path rust/crates/sky --root ~/.local --locked
```

The `sky` binary embeds the runtime, stdlib, and Sky Console.
End users only need `sky` on PATH and Go 1.21+ available for
codegen.

## Pick your shape — when to use what

Every shape is the same TEA-style `init / update / view / subscriptions`;
pick by where the loop should run and how you ship it.

You write ONE `App.app { init, update, view, subscriptions }` source and pick a
backend with a build-time `--target family[:variant]` (default `web`). You never
import `Std.Live`/`Std.Spa`/`Std.Tui`/`Std.Cli`/`Std.Webview` — `Std.App`
composes them all.

| You're building | `--target` | Reach for it when | Delivers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Interactive web app, server-driven** | `web` (default) | you want zero client build + instant first paint, server-owned state, and real-time updates over one SSE per session; the target is the browser today | **Sky.Live** |
| **Cross-platform app** (web · desktop · iOS · Android) | `web:app` · `desktop:mac` · `tablet:ipad` · `mobile:ios` | pure UI transitions should be **instant + local** (client wasm, no round-trip), the backend is a stateless API, and you ship to a webview (desktop/mobile) | **Sky.Spa** (client wasm) |
| HTTP / JSON API (no UI) | — | you're serving JSON/REST with typed routes + middleware, no rendered UI | **Sky.Http.Server** (`Server.listen 8000 [...]`) |
| Terminal UI (TUI) | `terminal:tui` | a rich terminal app — the *same* `Std.Ui` view, painted to ANSI cells | **Sky.Tui** |
| CLI tool / background job | `terminal:cli` | a one-shot command or line-oriented loop | **Sky.Cli** (or bare `main = Task.run ...`) |
| Native desktop window | `desktop` | a desktop `.app`/`.exe` wrapping your UI in a native window | **Sky.Webview** |

Add `App.withNotFound …` (mandatory for `web`/`desktop`) and `App.withRoutes […]`
to the same `appDef`; for a raw `Std.Html` view use `App.web` instead of
`App.app`, and for a hand-authored terminal `view : model -> String` use
`App.cli` / `App.tui`. `main = App.run appDef` is the entry for every target.

**Sky.Live vs Sky.Spa — the two TEA runtimes.** Sky.Live keeps the loop on the
**server** (per-user model, live SSE, a full re-render each interaction) — great
for a browser web app with zero client build and instant first paint. Sky.Spa
moves the loop to the **client** (compiled to wasm), so pure UI transitions are
instant and local, the backend shrinks to a stateless API, and the *one* codebase
ships to **web, desktop, iOS, and Android**. Same `Model / Msg / update / view`,
same `Std.Ui` `Element` — you pick the runtime, not a rewrite.

Every backend shares `Std.Ui` for layout, `Std.Auth` for sessions,
`Std.Db` for persistence, `Std.Log` / `Std.Trace` for
observability, and `Sky.Core.*` for pure primitives.

### Cross-platform + native device APIs (Sky.Spa)

`sky build --target web|desktop|ios|android` takes one Sky.Spa app to every
platform, and **`sky spa-split`** derives a wasm frontend + a stateless backend +
a shared codec contract from a single project. Native device capabilities are
plain typed effects (`Task Error a`) via **`Std.Native`** — clipboard, local
storage, geolocation, share, notifications, camera/photo/file pickers, battery,
and more.

> **Extending native platform APIs — experimental.** `Native.bridge` lets an app
> (or a distributable Sky library, with `native/ios/*.swift` + `native/android/*.java`
> and entitlement/manifest fragments) register its **own** native capability —
> e.g. Apple Pay / Google Pay — with **no compiler change**. This extensibility
> layer is an early, evolving feature; the API may change.

## What ships with Sky

A short tour. Full reference at `sky doc --serve` or
[docs/stdlib.md](docs/stdlib.md).

| Module                 | What it gives you                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Std.Ui`               | Typed no-CSS layout DSL (`row`/`column`/`el`/`button`/`input` + `Background`/`Border`/`Font`/`Region` subs). Renders to inline-styled HTML, ANSI cells, or native Webview from the same source. |
| `Std.Live`             | Sky.Live runtime — TEA app + SSE patches + session stores (memory / sqlite / redis / postgres) + routing + cookies + auth gates. |
| `Std.Spa`              | Sky.Spa runtime — the *same* TEA loop compiled to `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` and run on the client (web / desktop / iOS / Android). `sky spa-split` derives a wasm frontend + a stateless backend + a shared codec contract from one project. |
| `Std.Native`           | Typed native device capabilities as `Task Error a` effects — clipboard, local storage, geolocation, share, notifications, camera / photo / file pickers, battery, online/language/theme. `Native.bridge` + `native/<platform>/` lets an app or library add its own (experimental). |
| `Std.Bundle`           | Cross-platform packaging identity in code (`withName` / `withId` / `withIcon` / `withVersion` / `withPermission` / `withAsset`); `sky build --target` fills the Info.plist / AndroidManifest / icons / entitlements. |
| `Sky.Http.Server`      | HTTP server with typed routes, middleware (CORS / logging / rate-limit / basic-auth), streaming responses, WebSocket upgrade. |
| `Std.Auth`             | bcrypt password hashing, HS256 / RS256 JWT, register / login / roles. Typed secrets — never `fmt.Sprintf("%v", token)`. |
| `Std.Db`               | SQLite + PostgreSQL + MySQL via one interface. Connection pool, prepared statements, versioned migrations, `Db.RowDecoder`, `withTransaction`. Sky can also ship and supervise PostgreSQL itself — see below. |
| `Std.Db.Schema`        | Typed, dialect-safe schema DSL — define tables as values; `createTable` emits the correct `CREATE TABLE` for SQLite **and** Postgres from one definition (no `INTEGER`-overflow / `AUTOINCREMENT`-vs-`BIGSERIAL` drift). |
| `Std.Money` + `Std.Decimal` | Arbitrary-precision Decimal + currency-typed Money (50+ ISO 4217 codes + crypto) with `allocate` for fair splits and conversion rates. |
| `Std.Cache`            | LRU + TTL in-memory cache, parametric on key + value, monotone stats. |
| `Std.Analytics`        | Typed product analytics — typed event props (`Money` lossless, `Pii` redactable), consent-gated + anonymous by default, opt-in Sky.Live auto page-views, SQLite store, and a Sky Console **Analytics** tab (counts / recent / revenue-by-currency). |
| `Std.Email`            | Resend / SES / SendGrid / SMTP under one typed `EmailProvider`. `SKY_EMAIL_DRY_RUN=1` for tests. |
| `Std.Compression` / `Std.Csv` / `Std.Config` | gzip / zstd; RFC 4180 CSV; TOML / YAML / JSON decoders that mirror `Sky.Core.Json.Decode`. |
| `Sky.Core.WebSocket`   | Client + server bidirectional sockets. |
| `Sky.Core.Crypto`      | SHA-256 / 512, HMAC, RSA sign/verify, AES-GCM, ChaCha20, scrypt password derivation, AEAD constants. |
| `Std.Webview`          | Native desktop window (macOS in v0.1; Linux / Windows in v0.2). |

## PostgreSQL, without the setup

Developing on SQLite and deploying on Postgres is how dialect differences reach
users. So `sky` ships and supervises PostgreSQL itself, across four tiers:

```bash
sky db start | stop | ps                 # a per-project dev cluster, on a unix socket
sky db provision --embed                 # fetch + pin a PostgreSQL bundle
sky build --embed src/Main.sky           # bundle it INTO the binary → ./sky-out/app --embed
sky db provision --shared --app myapp    # one host cluster; a database + role per app
```

**The app binary never knows which tier it is in.** It consumes a DSN — only the
provisioner changes, so the same binary runs against a dev cluster, its own
embedded PostgreSQL, or a managed database, with no code change. Bundles are
built from source in CI (PostgreSQL 18.6, pinned) with an SBOM and a
GPL/LGPL/AGPL link gate, and published as `postgres-bundle-v18.6`.

**Where the embedded bundle runs:** it's a self-contained, **glibc**-linked
PostgreSQL, so it works on any normal Linux VM (EC2/GCE), a macOS/Linux laptop,
and `debian-slim`/`distroless` containers **with a mounted volume** — verified
end-to-end. It does **not** run on Alpine (musl), bare `FROM scratch`, or Windows
(use WSL2 or a system Postgres), and a stateful database is the wrong fit for
stateless functions (Lambda / Cloud Functions → pair with managed PG). Full
matrix: [docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md](docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md).

**It fits in 1 GB.** On the e2-small this was measured on, a Sky.Live app plus
its own embedded PostgreSQL leaves the machine **~410 MB** short of its total
before a single session exists — `MemTotal − MemAvailable`, OS included, with
the app idle at ~21–27 MB and PostgreSQL costing **+28.4 MB** of that
(`docs/perf/runs/gcp-embed-postgres-20260815/sweep.tsv`, analysed at
[docs/perf/skylive-interaction-cost.md](docs/perf/skylive-interaction-cost.md#embedded-postgresql-measured)).
Without the database it is ~382 MB. So a free-tier or entry-level cloud
instance runs a real app with a real database, and the managed-database line
disappears from the bill.

Sizing is measured on real GCE instances, not guessed
([docs/perf/](docs/perf/skylive-interaction-cost.md)): a session's marginal
cost is **625–650 kB** on x86 with a PostgreSQL session store (451–531 kB on
the memory store, stock `GOGC`), and **CPU runs out well before memory does**
— an e2-small with embedded PostgreSQL sustains **~64 interactions/sec at 300
sessions**, an e2-medium **~262** (commit `3ed83c08`;
[docs/perf/runs/gcp-x86-capacity-20260816/](docs/perf/runs/gcp-x86-capacity-20260816/)).
Count **physical cores, not vCPUs** — a GCE vCPU is an SMT thread, worth
~1.27×, not 2× ([runs/gomaxprocs-scaling-20260816/](docs/perf/runs/gomaxprocs-scaling-20260816/)).
And on a burstable e2 instance plan with the **sustained** figure: a rested
e2-small's first run measured **2.7×** what it then sustained.

A single instance has no replica — `--shared` generates a backup timer, a lone
`--embed` app does not, so schedule a `pg_dump`. Full sizing:
[docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md](docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md).

A Sky app process opens four PostgreSQL-facing pools, and on a shared server
their sum is the binding constraint — the arithmetic is worked through in
**[docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md](docs/skydb/embedded-postgres.md)**, along
with the full design and the tier-by-tier trade-offs.

> No `postgres-bundle-v*` release has been cut yet, so `sky db provision
> --embed` has nothing to fetch. `sky db start` works today against
> `SKY_POSTGRES_BIN`, a local bundle, or a system PostgreSQL.

## Observability — built in

Every Sky.Live and Sky.Http.Server app auto-mounts:

- `/_sky/console` — Std.Ui dashboard with overview, logs,
  metrics, traces, errors (production-gated via
  `SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH`).
- `/_sky/metrics` — Prometheus scrape endpoint
  (`sky_live_requests_total{route,status}`, latency histograms,
  drop counters).
- `/_sky/healthz` / `/_sky/readyz` — liveness + readiness probes.
- `/_sky/buildinfo` — commit, build timestamp, Sky version.

Run **`sky console serve`** to stand up a central hub that
multiple Sky apps push telemetry to via the `HubExporter`
(OTLP/HTTP). See [docs/history/v0.16.x-console/HUB.md](docs/history/v0.16.x-console/HUB.md)
for the multi-service dashboard, tenant isolation, and the
3-layer auth defense-in-depth model.

`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is honoured for the standard
OpenTelemetry collector — point at Honeycomb, Grafana Tempo,
Datadog, etc.

Telemetry **storage** tunes from your `config` binding (or
`SKY_TELEMETRY_*` env, which overrides it): counter/histogram
coalescing windows shrink the telemetry tables on a busy app, and
`Sky.Config.withTelemetryDbCapacity` drives an hourly database
size report that warns before you run out of room. See
[docs/observability.md](docs/observability.md).

## Going to production

```toml
# sky.toml
name = "myapp"
version = "1.0.0"
entry = "src/Main.sky"

[live]
port = 8000
store = "sqlite"          # memory / sqlite / redis / postgres
storePath = "sessions.db"
ttl = "30m"

[database]
driver = "sqlite"         # sqlite / postgres / mysql
url = "DATABASE_URL"

# Std.Auth has no [auth] section — it's a library. signToken takes the
# secret + TTL as arguments; SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET (≥32 bytes) comes from
# the environment, never a committed file.

[log]
format = "json"           # plain / json
level  = "info"
```

```bash
ENV=production \
SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH=token SKY_CONSOLE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -base64 48)" \
sky build src/Main.sky && ./sky-out/app
```

The production gate is `ENV` (then `SKY_ENV` fallback). Unset
or `dev` / `development` / `local` → dev mode. Anything else
locks down the dev console, banner, and metrics endpoint.

To let the app's own signed-in admins open the console instead of
sharing a token, set `SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH=app` and add
`App.withConsoleAuth` (see
[`docs/skyapp/overview.md`](docs/skyapp/overview.md#the-sky-console-for-your-own-admins--appwithconsoleauth)).

Deploy with `scp` + your favourite supervisor, drop the binary
into a Docker `FROM scratch` image, or run it directly on any
platform with a Go 1.22+ runtime.
